# Bowling Game Kata

> In this repository you'll find the **Christamas Kata** about a the score of a Bowling Game. This project has been designed for the Web _Development students_ of the first year. The goal of this Christmas project is improve the skills working with the OOP (Object-Oriented Programing) paradigm and feel comfort working with classes on Python.

## Motivation

One of the biggest motivations for this kata is that has been the most difficult if we compare it to the others. This one has been the hard challenge but the funniest one becuase everyone played bowling once in their life but none know the propper rules of the game. First of all we had to know how works the score card just to start to try to solve the kata. Really enjoyable, even more if you have watched the movie of KingPing.

## Content

> The content of this project it's separed into two different directories **Domain** and **Resources**.

### Domain

In this direcotry we will find that it's subdivided into another two, **src** and **test**.

- **src**

Inside _src_ we have the main program functional and completely operative to any game that could happen at bowling.

---

- **test**

Inside _test_ we have all the test cases that we have built to check the functionality of the program and if it runs correctly following the rules of the score of the bowling games and we added a few more test cases trying to break or find a bug in our program but it didn't happened.

### Original Program

In this directory we have a copy of our original program that was built without a class method and all of it inside the same function, we didn't followed the OOP(Object-Oriented Programing) paradigm at the beggining of our program, we have the original test cases, this ones still been the same ones but with a few small modifications to be able to execute Pytest and work with a class method on Python.

### Resources

The directory of _resources_ how it tells the name has been built to keep all the external resources to the bowling program, in it we will find:

---

###### Explained Bowling Program

In this document we will find an explanation of all our program, explained line by line and block by block with tha aim of the comprehension of the users that will visit our repository trying ot find a challenge to theirselves. How is our first program, we will find it built in just one function and without a class method but it won't supose any problem because when it has been modified to be able to work with a class method and to follow the OOP paradigm you should know that it keep the same structure then it will be easy to understand hoe it works for you.

## Reflections

It has been a really interesting kata and really enjoyable. Between the Christmass Projects i had i will choose this one straight away even knowing that it left me a few days musing how i could solve it. The first good point of this kata is that finally i learn how it works the score card of bowling. And the best thing is that now i trust myself more when it comes the moment of work with classes with Python. I got to know how the OOP (Object-Oriented Programing) paradigm it works and i had so many problems during this kata that i didn't know how to solve at the beggining but thanks to the deep research i could get over them and know how to react against this kinds of issues that i'll find in the future. An awesome kata, perfect to recmoend to the people that just has started to learno how to work with the OOP (Object-Oriented Programing) paradigm and loves the challenges.
